# RecycleStationsNYC

New York residents are estimated to produce approximately 12,000 tonnes of waste everyday. Each year a significant amount of the tax has to be allocated for collection, disposal and sending of waste to landfills. Landfills are responsible for 36% of all methane emissions in the US, one of the most potent contributors to global warming.
In the light of the exorbitant and long term environmental and economical effects, New York City has declared a 20 year Solid Waste Management Plan to reduce its waste disposal.
Recycling is undoubtedly one of the most vital part in order to achieve this goal. Currently it is found out that residential recycling rate stands at around 18%.
Currently, recycling stations are situated around the different boroughs of New York City. In this case study, I will examine the distribution of different types recycle stations across New York City's 5 boroughs and attempt to design a strategy for where to add more recycle stations in general and recommendations for deployment of specific waste recycling stations to fulfill inadequacies in each boroughs.
